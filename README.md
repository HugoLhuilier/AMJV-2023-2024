# AMJV-2023-2024
 
**Authors :** BOULANGER Teddy, LHUILIER Hugo

Here is our project for the AMJV module (Architecture et Moteurs de Jeux Vidéos) at Télécom SudParis. The goal was to develop an RTS game given a list of specifications (see below). This is a purely academical project : the objective was not to make a complete game, but only to show our ability to develop with Unity, using some good habits and design patterns, etc. Thus, the game is extremely buggy, not everything is implemented, and way too many assets are missing (which explains the abundance of cylinders in the game).
